[^^] The silicon inside a CPU package

**Microprocessors** are the tiny electronic chips which form the central processing unit of the computer system. Without them, computers are just a box. “A computer requires memory to hold programs and data, a processor to execute those programs using the data, and I/O (input/output) capabilities to interface to the outside world. The intense action takes place within the processor, and the microprocessor achieves integration of all of the processing functions on a single microchip(Furber)”.

Remembering the diagram from the [[How memory works|How memory works]] article.
